To use the bot, you will have to download puthon scripts and run them from your computer.

After you have your environment set up, you'll need to turn on your Drive API and run sample script in python.(https://developers.google.com/drive/api/v3/quickstart/python)
In order for the script to run properly, please ensure ther is a .txt file in your working directory called "api_test1.txt". It can contain anything, This file will be uploaded to your drive as a test.

When you have your API set up and you ran the sample python script, you can start the bot. (To see, if sample script worked, in your Drive should be a folder named TestFolder with file api_test1.txt in it.)

Just run the script named botv1.py and you can use the bot.
